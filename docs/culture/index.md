## Pillars of the Square

Stepping into the world of square dancing, you’re joining a tradition with deep roots and open arms. These four pillars are the foundation upon which square dancing everywhere is built: they guide how we welcome, how we organize, how we care for one another, and how we keep the joy and music alive.

1.	Fellowship & Friendliness

Square dancing is our shared bond and our open door. Whether we travel or host, we greet one another with warmth, courtesy, and genuine interest. Fellowship lives in handshakes, laughter, shared rides, and cheering on new dancers; friendliness is the welcome we extend every time we form a square. Let it never be said that we withheld a kind word or a place on the floor. Fellowship and friendliness are the cornerstone of every square.

2.	Participation & Structure

A healthy club is built by people who show up—in the square and behind the scenes. Accept roles, serve on committees, learn the calls, and honor timing and formations. Our structure gives the dance its shape and keeps the music moving. When you are asked, say yes in the spirit it was offered, and follow through with care. May you, and those who follow you, keep the flame of participation burning brightly and the structure sound.

3.	Integrity & Togetherness

We dance for the good of the whole square. Integrity means honoring the rules and one another: courteous conduct, safe hands, honest effort, and reliability. Togetherness means every dancer has a place and every voice can offer ideas that make the club stronger. Take an active part in all activities; in doing so, we become better and grow closer. May you, and those who follow you, keep the flame of integrity and togetherness burning long.

4.	Fun & Music

Music is the heartbeat of our activity, and fun is its bright spirit. Let patter and singing calls lift your feet and your mood; celebrate the tunes, the cues, the quick recoveries, and the shared smiles. Joy keeps us learning, laughing, and coming back, and music binds our movement into a living rhythm. May you, and those who follow you, keep the flame of fun shining and the music alive in every square.

## A Short History of Modern Square Dancing

Modern square dancing grew from a lively blend of European social dances (country dances, quadrilles) and North American folk traditions that took root in rural communities across the United States. By the early 1900s, local variants were flourishing, each region with its own calls, figures, and music. The 1920s saw a preservation push (often tied to old-time music revival), but the form we now call “modern” square dance really coalesced in the mid-20th century. In the 1930s and ’40s, traveling teachers and callers systematized instruction and spread the activity far beyond its birthplaces.

After World War II, square dancing boomed: magazines, records, clubs, and festivals knit together a national (and then international) network of dancers and callers. In 1974, CALLERLAB, the callers’ association, formalized shared teaching lists and standards, giving dancers a common vocabulary across clubs and regions while leaving room for creativity and local flavor.

Technology shaped the experience, too. As recorded music became the norm, patter calling evolved, tempos diversified, and the repertoire expanded beyond strictly “country” sounds. Costuming styles shifted with the decades; lesson structures adapted to new generations; and programs diversified (from Mainstream and Plus to Advanced and Challenge). Through all of this, the core remained: people learning together, moving together, and laughing together to live or recorded music.

A vivid regional chapter in this story is Mitcham’s Barn near Mount Spokane, Washington. Built from locally cut timber in the 1930s, the hall hosted its first dance on July 2, 1938—when only the floor and two walls were finished—and its floating floor and home-built ingenuity became part of local lore. In mid-century the building’s future wobbled, but the Preedy family stepped in: Dale and Cloyce Preedy kept the lights on and the floor full, founding the Barn Stompers club and dancing year-round while the hall doubled as a community hub. Over the decades they maintained and improved the structure (even re-engineering the roof to shed winter snow) and used the space for everything from children’s lessons to benefit events, evidence of how square dance halls often function as civic glue as much as dance venues. The Preedys also reintroduced live music at times, and, as the national scene standardized through CALLERLAB in the mid-1970s, they adapted, keeping the local tradition vibrant while connecting it to broader trends.  ￼

That blend of local stewardship and shared standards is the essence of modern square dancing. Clubs are grounded in place, story, and people, yet they’re linked by calls, teaching practices, and a generous culture of visiting. Whether your first square forms in a school gym, a church hall, or a storied barn in the pines, you’re stepping into a living tradition that keeps renewing itself: one square-thru at a time, one Yellowrock with a corner, one welcome at the door.
